    <p>Overall I am unsatisfied with this trip. I broke most of the constraints I set on myself for this trip.
    I did not keep good habits from this trip. I really just needed... to... slow... down... and take my time.<br>
    
    On a more positive note, the scenery I experienced was great. I'm more of a fan of vast empty areas, so
    I enjoyed the views in West Texax/New Mexico/Arizona. Same with the California/Oregon/Washington coastlines.<br>

    I met up with some friends in Albuquerque, San Franciso, and Seattle which each was a great time. 
    It was amazing to experience these cities even if it was for a brief period of time.<br>

    The V-Strom 650 is a tank. It made the trip with no issues. I changed my oil every ~3000 miles and cleaned/relubed the
    chain every ~1000 miles. A chain adjustment was performed at ~6500 miles, and the air filter was changed at ~9000 miles.

    <p>I am bitter thinking about this trip and not eager to tell others about it. <br>
    Fortunately, I learned a lot from it; About myself and solo traveling.</p>
